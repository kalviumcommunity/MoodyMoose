Project Title: "MoodyMoose : Your Personal Mood Buddy"

Project Overview:

MoodyMoose is a fun app that changes based on how you're feeling. You can tell the app if you're happy, sad, or silly, and the moose character will react with different behaviors, animations, and sounds. It’s like having a digital friend who understands your mood! The app also lets you play games and track how your mood changes over time. It’s a fun way to feel better and be creative!

Key Features:

Mood Selection: You can pick your mood, or the app guesses it based on what you type or how you act.

Interactive Moose: The moose changes its actions, sounds, and animations depending on your mood.

Mini-Games: Play fun games that match your mood, like popping balloons when you're happy or feeding silly food when you're feeling goofy.

Mood-Themed Visuals and Music: The app changes colors, backgrounds, and music to match how you're feeling.

Mood Tracker: A fun calendar shows your moods over time with cute icons.

Customization: You can unlock cool outfits and accessories for the moose based on your achievements or mood milestones.

Why This Project:

MoodyMoose is a fun and creative project that combines emotions, humor, and interactive design, making it an exciting challenge to work on. It’s interesting because it allows users to interact with the app based on their mood, creating a personalized and engaging experience. By building this app, I will improve my frontend skills by learning how to design dynamic elements and animations, while also gaining backend experience by implementing data storage with Firebase. Additionally, I’ll explore basic AI techniques through sentiment analysis to detect moods, and I’ll focus on creating an enjoyable, user-centered app that prioritizes fun and engagement.
